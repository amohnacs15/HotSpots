# Hotspots
### Under Construction

For any fans of the old HotSpots (if there were any), I am going to completely refactor the previous app into something that is a little more production friendly.  For the user this means the option to challenge your friends (or complete strangers) to share their "Spot Score", multi-user leaderboards, and the joy of knowing you are in a cooler location than everyone else.  From a development standpoint, it means the integration of third party libraries to support a clean and modular architecture, data that is always up to date and available anywhere with the use of SyncAdapters and FireBase's mBaas.  Last but not least, there will be an overhaul to the user interface to increase its efficiency and make it something people will actually want to look at and show  their mom.
